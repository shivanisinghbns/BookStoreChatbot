## Submission Instructions

- You are free to use any programming language and libraries to complete the tasks, but Python is preferred.

- **Book Search**: Extract the book title.
- **Order Status**: Extract the order ID.
- **Review Submission**: Extract the review content.
- **Store Policy Enquiry**: Identify the specific policy being inquired about.

### 5. Interface

Build a simple interface which allows us to enter a message and view results for the above tasks.

### Additional Task: Evaluation

No implementation is expected for this section. Consider ways to evaluate the performance of your classification and extraction system. Provide a detailed explanation of the chosen evaluation methods.
